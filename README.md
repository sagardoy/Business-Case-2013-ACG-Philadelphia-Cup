# Business Case in Mergers & Acquisitions and Leveraged Buyouts
#### Winner of the 2013 ACG Philadelphia Cup

This project provides a case example of M&A from financial, strategic, and operational perspectives from both the buy-side and sell-side of acquisition through leverage buyout. This case won the 2013 ACG Philadelphia Cup against 30 teams from MBA and Finance programs in the Philadelphia area. 

There were two rounds for this project: the first round saw the case from the sell-side and involved topics like valuation, deal structuring, and market intelligence; the second round, in which only 7 teams competed, saw the case from the buy-side and involved topics like LBOs, strategic acquisitions, leasing, and stakeholder analysis. 

We presented our results to two panels of business and private equity experts. The best review we received as a team was that the competition "wasn't even close," and that included Wharton, one of the most renown business schools in the world. From this project, I gained confidence in my ability to model complex cases in Excel, the importance of the quality of your teammates (we chose each other for individual strengths), the importance of polishing delivery and handing a Q&A.

The contents of this repository are the case and our presentation for both rounds in the competition.
